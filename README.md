# Leaf-Image-Classification-Using-Morphological-Features

## About
The process of identifying plants by analyzing their leaves using digital image processing techniques involves examining and extracting various morphological features such as shape, color, and texture. This approach leverages technology to automate and streamline the identification process.

Shape: The shape of a plant's leaves is an essential characteristic that can help in distinguishing different plant species. Leaves come in various forms, including round, oval, lanceolate, palmate, and lobed. By analyzing the shape of a leaf captured in a digital image, it becomes possible to compare it with a database of known leaf shapes to identify the plant species.

Color: The color of a plant's leaves can vary significantly and is another vital feature for identification. Leaves can be green, yellow, red, purple, or a combination of colors. Digital image processing techniques enable the extraction of color information from leaf images, allowing for color-based analysis and comparison with reference data. This helps in narrowing down the potential plant species.

Texture: The texture of a leaf refers to its surface characteristics, such as smoothness, roughness, veins, or patterns. Texture features extracted from digital leaf images can be analyzed to identify unique patterns or textures associated with specific plant species. This information can be compared with a database of known leaf textures to aid in the identification process.

By combining these three features—shape, color, and texture—through digital image processing techniques, it becomes possible to develop algorithms and systems that can automatically identify plants based on leaf characteristics.
